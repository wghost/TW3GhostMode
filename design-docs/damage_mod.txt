New damage formula:

Final received damage = ((Incoming damage - Blocked damage + Attack Power Base) * Attack Power Multiplicative + Attack Power Additive) * (1 - Damage decrease Percents).

Incoming damage = (Attack damage + Damage increase Points ) * (1 + Damage increase Percents).
Blocked damage = Total Armor - Armor penetration >= 0.
Total Armor = Armor + Damage reduction >= 0.
Damage decrease Percents = Damage resistance - Damage resistance reduction >= 0.

Incoming damage - Raw incoming damage.
Attack damage - Raw damage dealt by an attack, depends on weapon/sign used.
Damage increase - Direct increase of your weapon/sign damage.
Blocked damage - Amount of incoming raw damage blocked by armor.
Total Armor - Total armor value.
Armor - Damage type independent reduction of raw attack damage.
Attack Power Base - Bonus damage added to raw incoming damage.
Attack Power Multiplicative - Attack damage multiplier. Starting value is 1 (100%).
Attack Power Additive - Bonus damage added on top of attack damage.
Damage reduction - Damage type dependent reduction of raw attack damage, cumulates with Armor.
Remaining damage - Difference between attack damage and Total Armor.
Damage resistance - Reduction (in percents) of remaining damage.
Armor penetration - Reduction of enemy's Total Armor.
Damage resistance reduction - Reduction of enemy's damage resistance.
Damage received - Final received damage.
Sign Intensity - Sign effectiveness multiplier. Starting value is 0 (0%). Sign Intensity + 1 is an equivalent of Attack Power for sign damage.
Critical hit chance - A chance to deal critical damage. Starting value is 0.05 (5%).
Critical hit Power - Critical attack damage multiplier. Starting value is 0.25 (25%).

Attack Power on Statistics screen represents Attack Power Multiplicative.
Attack Power Additive is stealth stat which is never shown, but increased slightly with each level for both player and NPCs.
Attack Power Base is an NPC stat, increases with level.
