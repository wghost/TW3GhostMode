Mutation4  - Toxic Blood: Whenever you take damage the attacker receives 1% of the damage
             they inflicted for every point in your Toxicity level.

             Toxic Blood's description is misleading: it's not a damage, but a DoT effect

			 at 20% Vitality or less will trigger an automatic finisher.
			 
             Countering an enemy when they're at 15% of their full health kills them and
			 triggers a finisher or dismemberment.

             This shit exists only because counters are useless in the base game!

             25*3 knockdown chance for adrenaline.
