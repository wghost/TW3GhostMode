If you want to help with localizing the mod, use en.csv, copy it to corresponding localization file (for example, cz.csv), open it with notepad (or notepad++, which is more preferable), translate the text and send it to me: wghost81@gmail.com.

I myself make English and Russian localizations, but since English is not my native language, I'm always opened to suggestions on how to improve the wording of options and in-game descriptions.

If you want to compile localization files yourself, here's an example:
w3strings.exe --encode en.csv --id-space 992

w3strings.exe is w3strings decoder/encoder tool available on Nexus.

Note: Nexus site has an option to share your localization as a mod, linked to the original mod. If you decide to do so - you have my permission.
